# CPP_school21

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey.
Many languages are recommended to learn OOP.
We decided to choose C++ since itâ€™s derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will comply with the C++98 standard.
